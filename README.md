#Here are the coding projects I made at Stony Brook University

These include:
  A hotplate using MATLAB (initializePlate.m, updateTemperature.m)
  Analysis in GDP vs Medals won in the Olympics (with all the CSV files with relevant data associated and the analysis and extra visualizations)
  A function that takes two samples of data (even ones with missing values) and compares them (The RStudio Project)
  A pagerank and eigenvector miniproject (AMS325_HW4)
